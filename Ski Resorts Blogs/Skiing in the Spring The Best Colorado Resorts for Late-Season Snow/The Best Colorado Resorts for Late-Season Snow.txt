Still Snowing in Spring! The Best Colorado Resorts for Late-Season Skiing
I’ll let you in on a little secret: some of my favorite ski days in Colorado happen after the calendar officially turns to spring. While the ski season might be winding down in many places, Colorado’s high-altitude resorts often get some of their biggest snowstorms in March and April. Plus, the days are longer, the sun is warmer, and the atmosphere on the mountain is pure fun.

I've learned to love spring skiing for its unique blend of soft, slushy snow in the afternoons and a chance for fresh powder in the mornings. There’s nothing quite like getting a surprise powder day under blue skies and a warm sun. If you’re planning a trip later in the season, or just want to extend your ski year, you need to know which resorts hold on to the snow the longest.

Based on my experiences chasing late-season turns, here are the top Colorado ski resorts that I know can be counted on for incredible spring skiing and snowboarding.

1. Arapahoe Basin (A-Basin): The King of Spring Skiing
Arapahoe Basin, affectionately known as A-Basin, is famous for having one of the longest ski seasons in North America. They often stay open until June, and sometimes even into July! I’ve personally skied here in shorts and a t-shirt in May, and it's a truly unforgettable experience.

Why A-Basin is the best for spring skiing:

Incredible Elevation: The base area is located at 10,780 feet, and the highest point is over 13,000 feet. This high altitude ensures that the snow stays cold and lasts much longer than at other resorts.

The Beach: A-Basin's parking lot is legendary for its vibrant spring party scene. People set up grills, chairs, and coolers, turning it into a massive tailgating party. It's the perfect place to hang out and relax after a day of skiing. I’ve enjoyed countless post-ski beers and burgers here with friends.

The Terrain: While all the terrain stays open late, the "East Wall" and "Pallavicini" lifts hold snow for what feels like forever. The spring snowpack on these advanced runs is a unique challenge and a ton of fun.

Endless Season: Knowing you can ski here well into the spring means you don't have to rush your trip.

If late-season skiing is your goal, A-Basin should be your non-negotiable first choice.

2. Loveland Ski Area: The Local's Favorite for Late-Season Turns
Loveland is another high-altitude gem that keeps its lifts spinning long after others have called it a season. It’s located right on the Continental Divide, which means it gets consistent snow and holds onto it well. Plus, its proximity to Denver makes it perfect for a late-season day trip.

Why Loveland is great for spring skiing:

High Elevation: With a base elevation of 10,800 feet, Loveland’s snow is reliable well into April and beyond.

Great Deals: As the season winds down, Loveland often has excellent deals on lift tickets, rentals, and lessons, making it a budget-friendly option for getting those last turns in.

Vibe: The atmosphere at Loveland in the spring is very relaxed and local-focused. It’s a great place to avoid crowds and just enjoy the sunshine and snow.

The Continental Divide: Standing on top of the mountain and seeing the snow-covered peaks stretching out on both sides of the Divide is a special sight, especially in the spring sun.

I’ve had some fantastic spring days at Loveland, and it’s always a reliable choice for a fun, late-season outing.

3. Breckenridge Ski Resort: High-Altitude Variety and a Vibrant Scene
Breckenridge is a massive resort, and its sheer size and high altitude mean that its slopes hold up incredibly well late into the season. Plus, its lively town and packed spring calendar of events make it a top choice for a full vacation.

Why Breckenridge is great for spring skiing:

Highest Lifts in North America: Breckenridge’s highest lifts, like the Imperial Express SuperChair, take you up to almost 13,000 feet. The snow at that elevation sticks around well into the spring.

Massive Terrain: With five peaks and over 2,900 acres of terrain, there’s plenty of skiing to be had. Even as lower-altitude runs close, there is always plenty of snow to find up high.

Lively Town: The historic town of Breckenridge comes alive in the spring with live music, patio dining, and fun events. It's the perfect place for après-ski relaxation.

The Park Scene: Breckenridge has some of the best terrain parks in the world, and they're usually in fantastic shape in the spring, which is great for park-goers.

I love the mix of great skiing and a fun town atmosphere that Breckenridge offers in the spring.

4. Aspen Snowmass: The Spring Break Hotspot with Pristine Conditions
Aspen Snowmass is a world-class resort complex, and it’s one of the top destinations for spring break. It’s also one of the best for late-season conditions. The huge size of Snowmass mountain, in particular, means that you can always find excellent skiing well into April.

Why Aspen Snowmass is great for spring skiing:

Expansive Terrain: Snowmass is enormous, and its high-altitude terrain (its peak is over 12,500 feet) holds snow exceptionally well.

Legendary Parties: Aspen is known for its incredible après-ski scene and spring break parties. If you’re looking for a good time off the slopes as well as on them, this is the place.

Pristine Grooming: The resort does an excellent job of grooming its runs, which is crucial for spring conditions that can get slushy. I've always been impressed with how well they maintain their slopes.

Variety of Resorts: With four mountains on one pass, you can choose where to ski based on where the best snow is, with Snowmass often being the go-to for spring.

I’ve had some of my most fun ski days in Aspen in the spring, and I highly recommend it for a memorable late-season trip.

So, don't put your skis away just yet! As winter fades, the opportunities for great skiing in Colorado only get better. With fewer crowds, warmer weather, and the chance for surprise powder, spring skiing is an experience you won't want to miss. Happy shredding!
